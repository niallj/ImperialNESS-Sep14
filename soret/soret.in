#We must now define the regions for both the hot and cold thermostats
#do this with the region command. It will be easiest to define 3 cuboidal regions
#as shown in the figure above and the use the union command to join the two hot regions
#<------------------

#Use the compute temp/region command to calculate the temperature in the hot
#and cold region
#<-----------------
#set up a basic velocity rescale for the hot region using the
#fix temp/rescale command

#change the thermostat to only act on the "hot region" using the

### MOMENTUM CONSERVATION

#Use the fix momentum command to reset the linear momentum of the system to zero

#Set thermodynamic output to time-step,temperature,potential energy,pressure, KE energy change in cold region, KE energy change in hot region.

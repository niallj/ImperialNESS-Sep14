### LAMMPS input script that creates a simple cubic lattice of Lennard-Jones particles
### and equilibrates it at the requried temperature.

### Brief descriptions of the purpose of each command are provided
### For more information, see http://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/Section_commands.html#cmd_5

#contains variables about the target system e.g. temperature, desnsity
#and also sets up some common simulation properties that should be the
#same across runs
include settings.in

# Generate a simple cubic lattice
# The lattice spacing is determined by the required density
lattice sc ${density}

#create a geometric region with 15 lattice points on each side
region sim_box block 0 15 0 15 0 15

#create a simulation box which occupies the region sim_box, containing
#1 atom type
create_box 1 sim_box

#place one atom of type 1 on every lattice site in the box
create_atoms 1 box

#set the atomic masses
mass 1 1.0

#use Lennard-Jones pair interactions without a cutoff of 3.0 sigma
pair_style lj/cut/opt 3.0

#set epsilon and sigma to 1.0
pair_coeff 1 1 1.0 1.0

#set the skin distance for neighbour-list generation to 2.0 sigma
neighbor 2.0 bin

#set the timestep
timestep 0.0025

#initialise all atomic velocities by drawing from a Gaussian distribution
#at the required temperature. ensure that there is no net linear momentum.
velocity all create ${temperature} ${random_seed} dist gaussian mom yes

#apply a Nose-Hoover thermostat to the system to bring it to the required temperature
##the Nose-Hoover damping time should typically be around 100 timesteps
variable tdamp equal 50.0*dt
fix nvt all nvt temp ${temperature} ${temperature} ${tdamp}

#specify which thermodynamic quantities are output
#we want only the number of the timestep, the temperature, and the total energy
thermo_style custom step temp etotal

#output thermodynamic information every 10 steps
thermo 10

#run the simulation for 1000 timesteps
run 50000

#store the current state of the system in a restart file

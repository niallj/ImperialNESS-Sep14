### LAMMPS input script that creates a simple cubic lattice of Lennard-Jones particles
### and equilibrates it at the requried temperature.

### Brief descriptions of the purpose of each command are provided
### For more information, see http://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/Section_commands.html#cmd_5

#contains variables about the target system e.g. temperature, desnsity
#and also sets up some common simulation properties that should be the
#same across runs
include settings.in

#read the output of the equilibration run

#start counting timesteps from 0 again

#run in the NVE ensemble
fix nve all nve

#specify which thermodynamic quantities are output
#we want only the number of the timestep, the temperature, and the total energy

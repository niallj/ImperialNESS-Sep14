!       Format of file is KEYWORD = value
!       Key-value pairs can appear in any order in the list
!       Avoid using 'D' which is normally used for denoting double precision
!       since this is causing an issue with th perl script that will be sorted at a later date.

! using ISTART = 0 will begin a simulation from a square/triangular lattice
! using ISTART = 1 will restart the simulation from a previous configuration - you MUST have the file
!                  restart.txt in your directory for this to work. copy it from another recent run.

!ISUB controls the frequency by which block averaged data is stored. An ISUB of 5000, say, would
!write a block average to file every 5000 timesteps. You need at least 100 of these to get a
!non-zero standard error in results.txt. In this example, NTS would have to be 500,000. or if
!NTS was 100,000, ISUB would need to be 1000.
